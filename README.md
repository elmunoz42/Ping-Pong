## Known Bugs

_There are no known bugs in the master branch. Please feel free to notify me at elmunoz42@gmail.com if you find any bugs. The rhythm-ping-pong branch has a bug in that while it is seemingly processing the input in the correct rhytmical fassion (one frame per second) it was only outputting to the DOM after the function processed all the results. _
